## TODO

- [ ] Improve responsiveness during long operations
   - [x] Add progress bars
   - [x] Run them in a separate thread and avoid freezing the main application
   - [ ] Send texture data to GL in smaller tiles, across several re-draws to avoid stalling main app
- [ ] Add log-linear and log-log histogram options?
- [ ] Improved DNG/demosaicing pipeline
   - [ ] Improve DNG color correction
   - [ ] Allow skipping DNG demosaicing during load
   - [ ] Add demosaicing/color correction/white balancing post-load filters
   - [ ] Will require storing DNG metadata to apply correct color-correction matrix
- [ ] Selection support
- [ ] More image filters/transformations/adjustments 
   - [x] Canvas size/cropping
   - [ ] White balance adjustment
   - [ ] Brightness/contrast
   - [ ] Luminance/chromaticity denoising 
   - [ ] Levels
   - [ ] Hue/Saturation
   - [ ] Convert to grayscale/desaturate
   - [ ] Invert
   - [ ] Equalize/normalize histogram
   - [ ] Match color/histogram matching
   - [ ] FFT-based convolution/blur
   - [ ] Motion blur
   - [ ] Merge down/flatten layers
- [ ] Enable processing/filtering images passed on command-line even in GUI mode (e.g. load many images, blur them, and then display them in the GUI, possibly without saving)
- [ ] HDR merging
- [ ] HDR tonemapping
- [ ] General image editing
   - [ ] Clone stamp
   - [ ] Airbrush
   - [ ] Cropping
- [ ] GUI improvements
   - [x] Add support for resizing side panel
   - [ ] Allow error logging to output to a debug status panel in the GUI.
   - [ ] Improved drop-down menus
   - [ ] Save all
   - [ ] Close all
   - [ ] Show command history and allow undoing/redoing multiple steps at once

## Known bugs
- ``stb_image`` seemingly does not properly handle sRGB's non-gamma curve. loading an sRGB image, saving as sRGB, and loading back in as sRGB should result in same image but doesn't (at least for PNGs). ``stb_image`` seems to assume just a simple gamma curve for sRGB (defaulting to gamma=2.2), and excludes the linear regions near black
